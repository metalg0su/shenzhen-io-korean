*Currents: Meet, Share, Explore*
Central Hub, Room D - Every 3rd Friday

What amazing science or technology are you working on here in Avalon City? Currents is a place for everyone to present their research projects and programs with an eye toward encouraging cross-disciplinary inspiration and cooperation. Feeling stuck? Someone with experience in a wildly different field from yours may provide just the inspiration you need!

*The Avalon Lounge*
Grigoryan North Ballroom - Weekly on Thursdays

What happens when you build a brand new city in the middle of the sea? Everyone is new! The Avalon Lounge is a weekly, low-key gathering for employee-citizens to meet each other and make connections— be they professional, social, or romantic. The music is kept low so everyone can enjoy the conversation.

*The City on the Sea: Photography by Dr. Enzo Capretti*
Ennis Theater, Foyer

Most of you know him as Avalon City’s indomitable operations chief, but Dr. Capretti is also an accomplished photographer whose work has been exhibited in galleries across Italy and the world. These images, documenting the construction of Avalon City from its first platform to the glittering metropolis it is today, offer an insider’s view of President Sun Haotian’s audacious plan and the daring feats of engineering that made it a reality. 

*The Art of Proteins*
Yan Library, 1st Floor

Proteins make the fundamental processes of life possible, yet they can also be used in other surprising ways. Presented by the Avalon City Biology team, this group exhibition is a playful exploration of the ways proteins can become fashion, sculpture, and even interactive games. Bring a jacket, as some of the installations involve fluid!
