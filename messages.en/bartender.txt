Subject: Airline cocktail mixer
From: Joe (周海涛) <joe@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

I was inspired by a flight I was on recently. Most of the drinking options were whatever the flight attendants could throw together—just a mixer and a small selection of liquors. A drink-mixing device could be made in an easily portable case and could dispense a wide variety of drinks for customers. I did my homework and called several airlines to gauge their interest and reception to the idea was good, so I think we should go ahead and try to develop this product. I’ve also designed out an initial selection of drink ingredients and mixes, which I’ve sent along. In the meantime while the engineering effort moves forward, I will create a marketing and rollout plan.

Hey, I wanted to say thanks for sticking with me when things weren’t going so hot. I know I was struggling for a while there and came up with some really bad ideas that went nowhere. But I have a better handle on things now and that’s thanks to your willingness to be patient with me. So yeah, um, I really appreciate that.

If you wanted, maybe we could get dinner or something sometime?
