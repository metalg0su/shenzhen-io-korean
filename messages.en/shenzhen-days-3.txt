Subject: Shenzhen Days: Say cheese!
From: 刘畅 <tilly88@words.creation>

Okay, remember when I said I only had one thing to complain about Westerners living here? Well I have another one so SORRY but here I go. It’s complaining about CHEESE. That’s right. Talking non-stop about your PRECIOUS, PRECIOUS CHEESES and how they don’t exist here. DEFINITELY not in the quantity, quality, and variety that they do in France or Wisconsin or wherever.

Well, it might be hard to wrap your head around the fact that an entire civilization and one of the top culinary traditions in the world was developed entirely without curdled milk solids, but it’s true. It happened. Which is not to say I don’t like cheese myself. I do! Late at night you might even find me at the McDonald’s on Shennan Road eating cheeseburgers like the gluttonous young modern global citizen that I am. I’m just saying there’s plenty of good and legitimate food that exists without cheese and it’s not like you’re going to DIE for lack of it…

Anyway, when you take a picture you don’t say “cheese” in China because why would we say that? You say eggplant. You heard me. 茄子, qiezi. Say it right and it kinda sounds like “cheese.” Maybe.

Yrs,
Tilly
