Subject: Pocket I Ching oracle
From: David 戴维 P. Solomon <daiwei@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

Have you noticed the 易經 (I Ching, sometimes known in the West as “The Book of Changes”), experiencing a resurgence in popularity lately? For the benefit of those out of the loop, let me briefly explain: A hexagram is a set of six lines where each line is either solid or broken, with a total of 64 possible combinations. There is obviously much more to it but I don’t want to go into it too deeply!

I’ve been studying the system for a while now, but I wish there was a quicker way to generate hexagrams. I thought perhaps this ancient divination method be brought into the modern era somehow as a pocket device.

Six coin flips, is it then?

Not at all. There is a much more detailed process through which one arrives at the reading involving yarrow stalks. I stopped by to try to describe it to you but you weren’t at your desk… Suffice it to say that we will need to generate the readings in the *proper* way if it is to be taken seriously as a divination tool!

I found a part that works for this. It implements the physical yarrow stalk method in miniature (MEMS). Strange.

So, we can just create the display for the result.

Obviously, interpretation is up to the user…

Splendid! How wonderful that such a device was created right here in China, where it all began! I’ll probably even use this oracle myself as Xiaomei and I approach our wedding day. :)

David is more Chinese than even a Chinese person.
