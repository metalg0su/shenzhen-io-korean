Dr. Suemura has been working on the design of a printable lattice for neural processing units that weaves a growth medium around a nanoscale trellis-like structure. We now need to devise a process to produce them, which is where you come in.

Let me know as soon as the device is ready so we can put these into manufacturing immediately.

Great. 

Lisa is very busy at the moment but instructs me to pass along her thanks.
