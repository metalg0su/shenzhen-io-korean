Subject: Remote kill switch
From: 张杰 <zhangjie@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

I would like to have a remote kill switch for autonomous systems (robots). This is in case of failure of the autonomous system. Of course, such a switch would not be needed if we always designed the system correctly…

We should make this.

I will create the transmitter and you will create the receiver.

Sweet! Can’t be too careful when you make robots, am I right or am I right?

(I am learning some more casual-style English from Joe.)
