Surely many of you have heard of Sun Haotian (孙昊天). His father was one of the first electronics entrepreneurs from this area, starting from when it was first designated a Special Economic Zone. Now that he’s inherited the family business, it would be no exaggeration to say he’s the most powerful man in Shenzhen today.

An opportunity has arisen to work with his conglomerate on a device that moves between stations in a line. Apparently, it’s intended to service an automated aquaponics facility. It’s a small start, but understand that our relationship with him is absolute top priority. If he feels he can trust us, we’ll continue to get bigger and better work from him.

What’s an aquaponics?

A system for growing food that combines aquaculture and hydroponics. Look it up.

This robot probably cleans or adds nutrients to the system as needed.

I’ve received word that Mr. Sun was happy with the result of our work here. 

Clearly it’s part of a much larger project, but nobody I speak to will say anything more.
