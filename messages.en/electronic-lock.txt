Subject: Security nightmare
From: Carl Tesky <carl@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

Remember SleepCUBES, the capsule hotel company we did the little game console for? They’re back, this time asking for a lock that’s based off the national ID card. Loads of privacy concerns here, not to mention the fact that a trivially cloneable master key opens any lock (!!!), but, a job’s a job as they say. 

At least I think that’s what they say.

I’ve stayed at SleepCUBE a few times. They’re not too shabby!

Get thrown out of a club or something?

I was researching our customer! Actually using the product or service is a great way to familiarize yourself with a company... it’s a natural part of any healthy corporate partnership!

Heh. You’ve really changed, Joe.

This is the least secure security solution I’ve ever seen. And I’ve worked on voting machines!

If you ever stay in a SleepCUBES, bring your own lock.
