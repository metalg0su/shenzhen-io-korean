Subject: Replacement factory module
From: 张杰 <zhangjie@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

Our factory floor has some examples of older equipment that require control signals to be amplified. We had a device to adjust signals for this type of machine, but recently it was broken (smashed).

This is an appropriate project to teach you about inputs.
