Subject: Infrared sensor - IMPORTANT
From: Wu Lili 吴丽丽 <wulili@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

All,

I am in the process of setting up closer tie-ups with top global firms and am working to secure higher-profile work for our company. The first result of these efforts is a contract to create an infrared sensor. This allows us to participate in the booming market for passive monitoring stations to detect illegal activities. Illegal carbon emissions, illegal growing operations, illegal immigration… if it’s against the law and it generates heat, we’ll detect it.

Just letting you know that your design for the infrared sensor component was well-received by our partners and is set to be integrated into a number of products currently under development by various defense and security firms. Obviously, our performance here opens the door to more jobs of this nature, so thank you for contributing to Longteng’s future.
