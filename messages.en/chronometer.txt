So this is going to be a funny thing to ask for with all our advanced technology here, but something we could really use is a dedicated handheld timer.

We’ve begun developing recipes for every conceivable kind of food in the cleanrooms, and one critical thing is to understand exactly how long certain reactions take. Unfortunately, earlier today I saw Derrick using his phone to do that, and... let’s just say I had to put a stop to that as quickly as possible. Phones are absolutely not sterile. They are the opposite of sterile.

Haha, sorry about that. I never realized how dirty a phone could be, but now that I think about it... yeah.

Well, the timer is nothing fancy, just something all the technicians can use to keep track of how long things ought to take, wrapped in a hardened case we can throw in an autoclave.

Thanks, you’re a lifesaver. I never thought I would live it down, using my phone in a cleanroom like that...

We all make mistakes, Derrick. Just remember it for next time and you won’t have to see Lisa become Angry Lisa ever again.
