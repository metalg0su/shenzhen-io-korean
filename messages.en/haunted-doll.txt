Subject: Can you keep a secret?? Haunted doll project
Subject-short: Can you keep a secret?? Haunted…
From: Joe (周海涛) <joe@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

Hey, so… I was doing some research on the internet, it seems that if a doll is a HAUNTED doll, it brings WAY more interest. Haunted dolls that get caught on a life-stream are almost guaranteed to go viral. So what if we took some of the dolls from a factory around here and put some parts in them to “haunt” them, then distributed them along with the normal dolls to toy stores? OH MY GOD HAUNTED DOLL!!

We just have to keep it a secret, so it doesn’t leak that we’re manufacturing them here…

Joe. Are you serious right now.

This is brilliant. I love this.

I found some appropriate sound effects online, I think “Sinister Giggle” and “Blood-Curdling Cry” are the best of that bunch…

Now we just need a random number generator.

Preferably a haunted random number generator.

We have some unmarked chips from a long time ago in storage, the original purpose or maker is unknown. Seems interesting. I put some in the prototyping bin also.

Perhaps this part was created by a “ghost shift”.

That is just some joke (humor).

Perfect, J.

Let’s go terrify some life-streamers!

HAHA IT WORKED… kind of. Someone posted their haunted doll being haunted and it was starting to gain some attention, but very soon afterwards they opened up the doll and found the mechanism, so the mystery was solved pretty quickly.

But they still don’t know where it came from. And I believe that GHOST ELECTRONICS have a potentially very bright future in the marketplace. We could even build them during ghost shifts at our assembly lines! I will continue to research the possibilities!!!

Stop right now. I forbid you from doing anything further relating to ghost electronics.
