Subject: Security camera (fake)
From: 张杰 <zhangjie@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

This product is an imitation (mock) security camera. It has two blinking lights. The first light blinks in a regular pattern. The second light is an internet light, so it should be blinking in a more random (intermittent) pattern, to resemble data upload.

As you will notice, the design is partially complete already. A previous engineer left (quit) before finishing the assignment.

Note the timing diagrams in the Verification tab. When you Simulate, your outputs should match those expected values as indicated.

Let the simulation run until it has passed all of the test cases to make sure you have a proper solution.

I’m absolutely certain you’ll do better than that last person.
