IT BEGINS… I got us an incredible deal with a MAJOR eSports personality: THE SOLID STEEL GAMER! Her team’s contracted with us to make light-up signs that actually animate for her fans!!

As long as we can keep the cost down, they’re going to want tons of these to hand out at matches!!

Looks simple, just a few states.

Haha, the end result looks GREAT! I LOVE the way it looks like THE SOLID STEEL GAMER is REALLY clicking the mouse button and drinking her soda.

This is going to be HUGE!!
