Subject: Please enjoy a game
From: 张杰 <zhangjie@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

My daughter is learning programming. She created a simple card game.

Would anyone like to try it and give some feedback for her? I put a link on everyone’s desktop.

She is interested to become a game developer.

Wow J, that is both a lot more polished and far harder than I was expecting!

Your daughter’s managed to design quite the challenging patience game.

Maybe there could be an undo function?

She says she doesn’t think it needs undo, because it is actually quite easy once you develop some skill.

She really takes after you.

老张，请告诉你的女儿她的游戏有些太好了，以至于我得把它从海涛的电脑上删掉，好让他好好工作。
