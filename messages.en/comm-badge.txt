Subject: IMPORTANT - the big one!
From: 吴丽丽 <wulili@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

Here we go… the job I thought we’d get finally came in, and it came specifically for us from Sun Haotian himself. He’s calling it the SafetyNet Tracking Badge. Looking at the specs, it seems to have multiple functions including reporting the location of the wearer around multiple sectors (there is a map included, which I’ve put on your desk) and providing one-way communication.

I don’t think I can overstate how important this work is. Not only are my contacts hinting they’ll want hundreds of thousands of these, they want them very fast. Evidently they’re about to take the wraps off their big project very soon.

Please treat this as the culmination of all of our work so far—everything we have been working towards as a company. Now is the time to execute.

Thank you. As you know, it has long been my dream to see our company compete at the very top level of electronics engineering firms. With this contract delivered, we are finally there. I’m excited to see what Sun Haotian has been working on, and even more excited about continuing to supply top-quality electronics and engineering services for world-leading applications.

We cannot relax or become complacent now, but we can at least celebrate this achievement. Come by the break room today for a free cream puff. You’ve earned it.
