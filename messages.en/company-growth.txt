Subject: Growing the company - PLEASE READ
From: Wu Lili 吴丽丽 <wulili@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

All,

Over the last two weeks I have conducted a thorough review of the company's product lines. We are showing some signs of improvement over last year, but we are still creating multiple products with no point, no goal, and no larger plan.

I want everyone to think about how to focus on products that have the potential to truly change the world. Where are the devices that we feel proud of as a company? How can we earn respect? What future are we building toward? 

We must face these questions head-on and with all of our efforts in order to have a chance of becoming one of the world’s top electronics firms. My uncle named the company Longteng, “rising dragon,” for a reason.

Lili Wu
Vice President of Product
