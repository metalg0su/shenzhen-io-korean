Subject: Pollution sensing window
From: 张杰 <zhangjie@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

I am working on a smart window that reacts to particulate matter in the air (pollution). I need a controller that allows us to close the window when the level is too high and opens it again when the level is lower.

Good. By the way, maybe you noticed that this is a “sliding window algorithm” for a sliding window. Do you think that is funny?
