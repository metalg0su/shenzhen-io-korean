Subject: Rubbish audio thing
From: Carl Tesky <carl@longteng-co-ltd.gd.cn>

So a contract comes in to build a piece of audio kit. Sounds fun, right? I’ve always liked audio. This client promises that their little box will deliver “crisp highs and booming lows, all in perfect balance.”

Then I see their advert happens to include the much-vaunted algorithm that powers this thing. Ah.

Go on, take a look yourself.

I should mention I put a copy of said advert on your desk. Just look in the pile of papers marked “Supplemental Data,” since that seemed most appropriate…

I should *also* mention that we still have to do this, as sad as it is. Work’s work and all, even when you have to help a dodgy American company market rubbish like this as premium kit for audiophiles.

Holy crap, this thing is AWESOME! I hooked one of these babies up to my stereo at home and it blew the speakers clear OFF!!!! Does the job no question. Amazing!!
