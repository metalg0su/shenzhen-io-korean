Hey, remember the Cool Dad thing from a while back where he got arrested before he could start the tour and we got stuck with all those color-changing vape pens, and it was kind of a disaster? Well I just got a call from his people and…

HIS TOUR IS BACK ON!!! THEY WANT THE INVENTORY!!! We don’t have to dump them after all!! THey might even want MORE!!

I’M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

Finally some good news today.

I was very close to telling the accountants to take a write-down on all of that stock.

Hang on, are we sure this all wasn’t just some elaborate publicity stunt? You know, the old concert’s-off-no-wait-it’s-on-again ruse… no? Just me?

Alright, then.

There’s a rumor online that Cool Dad was actually FRAMED by his twin rivals DJ Like and DJ Subscribe!!

Will we get any sort of special deal on tickets? Xiaomei and I would be interesting in going.
