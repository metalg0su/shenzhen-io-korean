Subject: BRING OUT THE BARON!!

The BARON VON SCHNAPPS is in the house y’all!! I was out drinking last night and met someone from the company that owns this brand. There’s a drinking game they’re promoting that’s hella fun and off the rails!! I made a deal to supply them with little personal scorekeepers they can give away at their events.

Wait, what’s the game? What counts as a point? What would be a foul?

Surely not individual drinks…

I don’t remember the actual rules. Haha!

If you can’t remember the rules of the game you were playing, how sure are you that you actually made the deal?

Because they sent us a case with a variety of flavors!!

It’s very tasty stuff, come try some!

It’s already too late for me, but you can still save yourselves… heed my warning, do not drink of the Baron von Schnapps…

Bye then. See you in the next life.
