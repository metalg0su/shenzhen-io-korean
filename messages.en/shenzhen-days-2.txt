Subject: Shenzhen Days: Things visitors say
From: 刘畅 <tilly88@words.creation>

Today I want to talk about the goofy things visitors here tend to say. Actually, just one thing. It feels like, every time a certain kind of Western visitor comes to China and looks around, they go:

WAIT A SECOND, I thought China was COMMUNIST! So why is everyone SHOPPING at the STORE? What is UP with THAT?

And that’s when everyone around laughs, because, one, the dude always thinks he is making some good observation when we’ve heard that at least one trillion times before (trust me on this), and two, gosh. It’s complicated, okay? 

What’s important is that so many of these guys’ impressions of COMMUNIST CHINA still come right out of the 1970s and they are so SURPRISED when they get here, like they had no idea that things were changing dramatically here this whole time! Well hey, you haven’t been sitting around doing nothing since Nixon and neither have we. And we’ve built more than just the factories where all your smartphones and game consoles come from.

The world is changing, fellas. Empty your mind, don’t cling to your fixed ideas. I believe in you. Okay? Okay.

Yrs,
Tilly
