Hiya! It was great to meet you at New Citizen Orientation. As I was explaining, the Ocean’s Bounty program is an initiative to meet all of Avalon City’s sustenance needs using nothing but the sea around us-- and we could really use your help!

It turns out that feeding a city is as much about logistics as much as it is biology (sorry, Lisa)! We have literal tons of ingredients and other materials to move back and forth between the cold storage area and the labs, so I’ve been planning out a robot that can handle that sort of thing. I’ve got the mechanical aspects down, but the control system is where you would come in. Once it’s finished, there are probably applications all over the city, so this is a project with pretty big impact!

Great to have you on board!

Welcome to the team! I have to run, but it sounds like you’ve begun coordinating with Derrick already. Thanks for your help.

Ah, this is great! So satisfying to finally have the components we need for our food development projects ready when we need them… and without having to go in the freezer all the time. You’re the best!

Indeed, this is just what we needed to make forward progress. I think we’re getting close on the synthesized grains, too. My dream of creating a full seven-course French dinner made from nothing but materials derived from kelp is within sight!

That’s gonna be interesting, all right!
