The nonlethal devices work, but they don’t fire like conventional weapons. In particular the trajectories are slightly different and most of the security personnel here haven’t had a chance to become used to them. If we had a firing range where we could practice, I think we would feel a lot better about using them.

According to Lisa there is an electrical engineer in her department who could handle this. I’ll pass it along.

Yup, they’re working great and we’re already seeing improvements in accuracy. Numbers for you soon. Thanks for sorting that one out.
