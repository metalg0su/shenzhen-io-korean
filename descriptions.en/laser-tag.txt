* When a player is *respawned*, their vest should be set to *alive*.
* When a player *reloads* their gun, whether *alive* or not, their ammo count should be set to the ammo reload value.
* When a player is *alive*, pulls the *trigger*, and has ammo remaining, the gun should *fire* and the ammo count should be decremented by 1.
* To allow for "realistic operation" of various replica guns, the ammo reload value is set by the operator using a dial that can be read as an XBus input.
