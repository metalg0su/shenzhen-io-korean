* *sonar* is a simple input connected to a passive sonar sensor.
* *magnetic* is a simple input connected to a magnetic anomaly detector.
* *radio-rx* is a non-blocking XBus input connected to a radio receiver.
* *radio-tx* is an XBus output connected to a radio transmitter.
* When a data packet is received over the *radio* that specifies the ID number of this sensor assembly, respond with the 6 most recent sensor readings (including the current) from the requested sensor in order from oldest to most recent:

##############

|   ID number of    |   1 = passive *sonar* sensor
|  sensor assembly  |   2 = *magnetic* anomaly detector

* The ID number of the sensor assembly is stored in a secure identity chip that can be read as an XBus input.
