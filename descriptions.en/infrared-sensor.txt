* *time* is a simple input connected to a DT2415 clock providing the current time.
* *sensor* is a simple input connected to an infrared sensor.
* *alarm* is a simple output connected to a silent alarm.
* When the current *time* equals the on time, the device should be _armed_.
* When the current *time* equals the off time, the device should be _disarmed_.
* Whenever the device is _armed_ and the *sensor* reads at or above a value of 20, the *alarm* output should be active.

* The on and off times are set by the operator using dials that can be read as XBus inputs and use numerical values compatible with the DT2415.
