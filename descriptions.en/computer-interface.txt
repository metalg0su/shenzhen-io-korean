* *sense-0* through *sense-5* are simple inputs connected to neuroactivity sensors.
* *output* is an XBus output connected to a computer for analysis.
* When pulses occur on two or more *sense* channels within a window of 2 time slices, report the *sense* indices over *output*, in increasing order.
* Do not report the same pulse more than once.
