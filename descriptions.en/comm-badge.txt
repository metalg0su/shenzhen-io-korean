* When a data packet is received and begins with a value of 1, the subsequent data should be treated as length-prefixed audio data and played over the *speaker*.
* When a data packet is received that begins with a value of 2 and specifies the ID of the badge, the badge should respond with its current sector.
* The user’s location can be determined when a *radar-ping* pulse is detected by correlating the current heading and distance from the central tracking radar with the SECTOR MAP, which can be found as “Figure 7G” in the “Supplemental Data” section of the manual.
